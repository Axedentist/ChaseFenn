### Setup

1. Run `npm install` to get all Gulp dependencies. Install globally
2. Run `Gulp watch` to compile scss and js files.
3. If you add new scripts or scss files, make sure to add it to the `gulpfile.js`

From there, any changes made while `Gulp watch` is running will be compiled and minified. The compiled/minified files are the ones used by the website.
